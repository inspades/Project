# Project

Overview:
  An ad-revenue website called "SandPhighlow" or "indexpredictions" or something like that.
  Users will be required to register and confirm a valid email address.
  Users will login and input their predictions for the high and/or low of the S&P500 for that trading day. 
  A protocol will then show the user what the average prediction of all users for that day. 
  Ad revenue clients would likely be brokerage sites like Fidelity, Scottrade, etc. 
  
Additional options:
  Potentially the site could offer average predictions of any ticker of any kind. 
  Predictions must be within required perrammeters deemed to be realistic. 
  Users could be assigned stats or ranks based on accurracy of past predictions and be "followed". 
  Users could use their accuracy rating to self-advertise, e.g. a broker trying to attract new clients.
